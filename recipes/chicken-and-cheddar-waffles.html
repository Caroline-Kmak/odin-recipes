           <li>1.5 tbsp garlic powder</li>
           <li>1.5 tbsp paprika</li>
           <li>3 tsp cayenne</li>
           <li>2 tbsp salt</li>
           <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
           <li>1.5 c buttermilk</li>
           <li>8 c vegetable oil, for frying</li>
           <li>6 waffles</li>
           <li>1 c shredded cheddar cheese</li>
           <li>2 tbsp chives</li>
           <li>maple syrup, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Salt chicken and place in the refrigerator for 6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>When the chicken is ready, mix flour, cornstarch and spices in a medium bowl and set aside for dredging.</li>
            <li>Dredge all the chicken pieces in the flour mixture and place on a rack.</li>
            <li>Pour 4 tbsp of the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture and mix to make chunky pieces.</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken in the buttermilk. Then, pat the buttermilk-flour mixture onto each chicken piece - this is how you get the craggly pieces!</li>
            <li>Place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is chilling, prepare the waffles by making your waffle batter according to the box instructions, adding 1 c of cheddar and 2 tbsp of chopped chives. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Make your waffles according to the waffle maker instructions; place in a warm oven to keep hot.</li>
            <li>While making your waffles, start to heat the oil for frying until it reaches a 350 degrees (use a thermometer!)</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken pieces until deep golden brown about 5-8 minutes, turning the pieces frequently. Transfer to a wire rack set over paper towels to drain.</li>
            <li>Monitor the heat while frying to keep it at 350 consistently.</li>
            <li>When the chicken comes out of the fry, toss salt over it. Serve hot with warm waffles and maple syrup, plus chives for garnish.</li>
         </ol>
